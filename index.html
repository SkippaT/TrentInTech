                        <h3>Purpose</h3>
                        <p>
                            The drive for this application was to improve the throughput at an intersection with traffic
                            lights.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A traditional intersection uses a static timer method to cycle between the lights. This
                            means that the intersection will remain the same for a set period before transitioning 
                            to the next configuration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An adaptive traffic light system will be able to spend any amount of time in whichever
                            configuration it thinks is best. The system chooses the best configuration based on 
                            experience, using reinforcement learning.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Static Timer Method</h3>
                        <p>
                            A challenge I came across was how to configure the static timer system. It was important
                            that I made this system perform as best as possible because otherwise I will be cheating 
                            when I compare my results with a subpar static system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I ran many simulations (1000 iterations) each with a different number of iterations 
                            between light changes. Through different scenarios it was found that the number of 
                            iterations before changing the lights should be 7.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This resulted in my static timer system cycling between the traffic light configurations 
                            every 10 iterations (7 for the configuration + 3 for the yellow).
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="split">
                        <h3>Q Learning Agent</h3>
                        <h4>States</h4>
                        <p>
                            My definition for a state includes the current direction of the traffic lights and the
                            length of each queue at the intersection (each a separate feature).
                        </p>
                        <h4>Actions</h4>
                        <p>
                            The actions that my learning agent can choose from are each of the possible configurations
                            of the traffic lights.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Rewards</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Every time a vehicle leaves a queue and enters the intersection the reward is
                                incremented by 3.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Every time the traffic lights change direction the reward is decremented by 8.
                                This is to punish the agent for changing the lights. The more the lights change, the
                                more time they spend yellow (X) and no vehicles can clear the intersection.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the first vehicle in the queue leaves the reward is incremented by 3, otherwise the
                                reward is decremented by the length of the queue with a maximum loss of 3.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            When running simulations with my Q learning agent, the program first runs 3 episodes of 5000
                            iterations. For the first episode the epsilon value is set to 0.6 (60% of actions are chosen
                            at random), the next episode has an epsilon of 0.4 and then 0.2. These epsilon values ensure
                            that the learning agent has an opportunity to completely fill its Q table.

                        <h3>Testing and Results</h3>
                        <p>
                            To test the performance of my learning agent I compared it against the static timer method

                            Under even traffic distribution conditions, both methods performed well. However, when 
                            simulating peak hour traffic by overloading one or two lanes, the static timer method's 
                            performance significantly declined, whereas my learning agent maintained its throughput 
                            efficiency.

                    <p>
                        This project uses a Raspberry Pi to control music using the Spotify API.
                        Connected to the Raspberry Pi is an NFC scanner which reads my 'Music Cards' (NFC cards) and
                        performs a certain action depending on what card was used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also connected to the Raspberry Pi is an LED strip that is used for feedback and performs 'light
                        shows' based on which card is scanned.

                        <h3>Process</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                I began this project by first playing with the NFC scanner.
                                I created programs that waited for a card to be scanned and then
                                printed the UID to the terminal.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I next researched the Spotify API and created a program that takes user
                                input from the terminal to control my Spotify. This program could pause
                                and skip songs, play a playlist, album or song, toggle shuffle, adjust
                                volume and many other things.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I then combinded the two programs I'd made. This meant I was controlling
                                Spotify with the NFC cards.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The next step was creating some functions for the LED strip to perform.
                                Some of these functions are purely for show and others are for feedback
                                after a card is pressed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                With the application working properly, the final step was to install the
                                device in my room. To do this, I 3D printed a mount for the NFC scanner
                                underneath my bedside table. The LEDs were attached around the perimeter
                                of my bed out of sight.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Challenges and solutions</h3>
                        <p>
                            A problem I encountered in the testing process of this project was not being able to read
                            cards
                            while the LED strip was completing a light sequence. The problem existed because my Python
                            program would wait for a card to be scanned and then run a function depending on the card.
                            If the instruction on the card was to perform a light sequence with the LEDs, then the
                            program
                            would stop reading the scanner. This meant that I would have to wait for the light sequence
                            to
                            finish before I could scan the next card.
                        </p>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
                            To fix this problem I introduced threading to my program. Now when I scan a card that
                            initiates
                            a light sequence, a separate thread is created that will control the LEDs while the main
                            thread
                            continues to wait for a card to be scanned.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another obstacle I ran into was how to install the scanner under my bedside table close
                            enough
                            that it can read the NFC cards through the wood. Thankfully I was able to 3D print two rails
                            that I screwed under the wood. I could then slide the Raspberry Pi along the rails where it
                            can
                            sit in place and wait for a card to be scanned.<br>
                            I also printed a small catcher for the cables that was screwed under the wood to keep the
                            cables
                            organsied.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Final Product</h3>
                        <p>
                            The final outcome of this project is a record player/light controller hidden underneath my
                            bedside table and controlled by NFC cards. I can select a card, slide it along my bedside
                            table and my favourite artist will start playing. Slide another card and the LEDs in my room
                            will create a rainbow fade effect.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Future Work</h3>
                        <p>
                            The NFC cards currently have no style. I would like to print some graphics onto them to make
                            them
                            easier to read and look better.<br>
                            I also will be creating more complex and entertaining light sequences with the LEDs.

                        <h3>Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            This being my first tech project, I took baby steps in the development process and had no
                            end product in mind, I simply wanted to learn.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                I began by controlling a single LED with the Raspberry Pi and quickly progressed to
                                controlling three LEDs using a timer in Python.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A button was then introduced and used to control the three LEDs just installed. I wrote
                                code that would treat the three LEDs as the lights for vehicles and the button as a
                                pedestrian button. This meant that the lights were green until the button was pressed.
                                After the press, the lights changed to yellow for a few seconds and then to red. After
                                a few more seconds the lights went back to green.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I then added the two lights for the pedestrians and wrote code for them to be red unless
                                the pedestrian button was pressed and the vehicles' lights are red. I also wrote code
                                to make the pedestrian lights flash red for a few seconds before being a solid red.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The last addition to this project was the buzzer. This buzzer immitates the tone heard
                                at traffic lights and can be used to indicate when pedestrians can and cannot cross the
                                road.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Challenges and solutions</h3>
                        <p>
                            I came across an obstacle just about every step of the way. This being my first project I
                            was
                            fully prepared for plenty of speed bumps and did not let them get in my way.<br>
                            The problems I encountered were very simple and caused by a lack of experience. I overcame
                            them
                            by following instructions on how to complete similar projects.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Final outcome</h3>
                        <p>
                            After finishing this project I was left with a real world simulation of a simple set of
                            traffic
                            lights. The traffic lights for vehicles remain green and the pedestrian lights red until the
                            user
                            presses the pedestrian button. This then changes the vehicles' lights to yellow for a few
                            seconds.
                            The vehicles' lights then go red and the pedestrian lights go green. After a few seconds the
                            green pedestrian light flashes red for a bit and then goes solid red at the same time as the
                            vehicles' lights going green. Whenever the pedestrian lights are red, the buzzer beeps at a
                            slow
                            frequency, when the lights change to green, the frequency of beeps becomes much faster.

                    <p>
                        This university project was completed using Java and JavaFX to create a basic
                        graphic design application. The goal was to make a simplified version of the
                        Canva software available online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application uses SQLite to store user information such as usernames and passwords.
                        Following an MVC architecture the design of this application is very concise and
                        organised.

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                I began this application with the login page and create user page. I first create the
                                GUI's
                                and then worked on the code to add users to the database and authenticate user logins. I
                                also added a function to hash passwords.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I then built the base design of the application with no functionality.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The logout button was enabled and so was the profile button. The profile button allows
                                the
                                user to edit their account details, such as username and password. These updates are
                                reflected in the database and thus are persistent.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The next step was to allow the user to create a canvas and choose the dimensions in the
                                process.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I then wrote the code for adding text, images and shapes to the canvas. Each of these
                                elements have their own sidebar full of options to edit the element (colour, size, etc).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The last step was adding the ability for the user to save the canvas as a png image to
                                their machine.
                            </li>

                        <p>
                            This project was part of an early University course I completed, therefore, it gave me
                            plenty
                            of insights into the world of programming. Listed below are some of the things I gained
                            experience in.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Object-Oriented Programming</h4>
                        <p>
                            OOP is something I already had experience with but this course further solidified my
                            understanding
                            of it and ability to implement it. As a well practiced Java developer, OOP is something that
                            I
                            enjoy and understand well.

                        <h4>MVC Architecture</h4>
                        <p>
                            I followed the MVC architecture to separate my application into three components: the Model,
                            the View and the Controller.
                        </p>
