                    <h2>Interactive NFC Music and LED Controller</h2>
                    <p>This project uses a Raspberry Pi computer to control music using the Spotify API.
                        Connected to the Raspberry Pi is an NFC scanner which reads my 'Music Cards' and
                        performs a certain action depending on what card was used.
                    </p>
                    <p>Also connected to the Raspberry Pi is an LED strip that is used for feedback and 
                        because LEDs are awesome!

                        </ul>
                        <h3>Process</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                I began this project by first playing with the NFC scanner.
                                I created programs that waited for a card to be scanned and then 
                                printed the UID to the terminal.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I next researched the Spotify API and created a program that takes user 
                                input from the terminal to control my Spotify. This program could pause 
                                and skip songs, play a playlist, album or song, toggle shuffle, adjust 
                                volume and many other things.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I then combinded the two programs I'd made. This meant I was controlling 
                                Spotify with the NFC cards.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The next step was creating some functions for the LED strip to perform. 
                                Some of these functions are purely for show and others are for feedback 
                                after a card is pressed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                With the application working properly, the final step was to install the 
                                device in my room. To do this, I 3D printed a mount for the NFC scanner 
                                underneath my bedside table. The LEDs were attached around the perimeter 
                                of my bed out of sight.
                            </li>

                <h3>Raspberry Pi Traffic Light System</h3>
                <p>The first tech project I completed was a simple traffic light system using a 
                    Raspberry Pi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The traffic light system includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Green, yellow and red light for vehicles</li>
                    <li>Green and red light for pedestrians</li>
                    <li>Button for pedestrians</li>

                                I began this project by first playing with the NFC scanner.
                                I created programs that waited for a card to be scanned and then 
                                printed the UID to the terminal.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I next researched the Spotify API and created a program that takes user 
                                input from the terminal to control my Spotify. This program could pause 
                                and skip songs, play a playlist, album or song, toggle shuffle, adjust 
                                volume and many other things.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I then combinded the two programs I'd made. This meant I was controlling 
                                Spotify with the NFC cards.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The next step was creating some functions for the LED strip to perform. 
                                Some of these functions are purely for show and others are for feedback 
                                after a card is pressed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                With the application working properly, the final step was to install the 
                                device in my room. To do this, I 3D printed a mount for the NFC scanner 
                                underneath my bedside table. The LEDs were attached around the perimeter 
                                of my bed out of sight.
                            </li>
